"""
Singleton Pattern (Creational)
Purpose: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

How It Works: The Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.
It is implemented by creating a class that checks whether an instance of itself already 
exists and creates a new one if it doesnâ€™t.

Use Case: Singleton is often used in configurations, logging, database connections,
file managers where a single point of control is necessary.
