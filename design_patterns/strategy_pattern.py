"""
Strategy Pattern (Behavioral)
Purpose: Enables selecting an algorithmâ€™s implementation at runtime.
How It Works: The Strategy pattern involves defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable. The algorithm can vary independently from clients that use it.
Use Case: The Strategy pattern is useful in scenarios where you need to dynamically switch algorithms based on context, such as different data compression or encryption methods.
